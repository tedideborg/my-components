# My components

My components is a website for my components that I have gathered throught the years. I want to keep it simple and I like to just being able to copy paste it easily.

## Usage

Simply fire it up locally with a server, I use VS Code Live Server, and you are good to go.

## Todo:

-   [x] When I have too many components to fit into one page, create subpages for game components and web components
-   [ ] Make footer look nicer
-   [ ] Rewrite the data files to json or some other format
