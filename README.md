# My components

A random collections of nice, reusable components and code snippets I've found throughout the years.

## About this site

This site is mostly an experiment for not using any build tools (no webpack, npm or anything like that) but still get the benefits from modern web develpment. I've used [SolidJs](https://https://www.solidjs.com), [Navigo](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo), [md-block](https://md-block.verou.me), [PrismJs](https://prismjs.com) and [PicoCss](https://picocss.com) to build it. It's small, it's fast and it's extremely easy to get up and running with it. Some of it's features:

-   ♻️ Re-usable components
-   📦 States
-   🔀 Routing
-   📙 Reading and printing Markdown files
-   ☀️ Light and dark mode
-   ✏️ Code highlighting for code snippets
-   ⌨️ Typescript similar type checking (using JsDocs and vs-code)

All that and more without any build step or huge node_modules folder

## Usage

Simply fire up the index.html file locally with a server, I use VS Code Live Server, and you are good to go.
